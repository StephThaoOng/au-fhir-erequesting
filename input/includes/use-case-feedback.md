This baseline set of use cases for AU eRequesting R1 was agreed in the Sparked Face-to-Face workshop in Melbourne. Commentary on these use cases will open on 01 Mar 2024, and they are expected to evolve alongside the AU eRequesting R1 Implementation Guide. We require your feedback to help refine these drafts. Please provide your feedback including improvement suggestions on <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HAFWG/AU+eRequesting+TDG+-+R1+Use+Cases">AU eRequesting R1 use cases</a> Confluence page.
