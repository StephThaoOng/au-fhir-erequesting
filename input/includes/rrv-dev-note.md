Work is underway within [RANZCR](https://www.ranzcr.com/) to finalise the development of the Radiology Referral Set (RRS) with the aim of including all radiology procedures performed in Australia. The [RANZCR Radiology Referral](https://www.healthterminologies.gov.au/integration/R4/fhir/ValueSet/ranzcr-radiology-referral-1) value set published in the [NCTS](https://www.healthterminologies.gov.au/integration/R4/fhir) is an evolving draft that is derived from the latest agreed set of concepts from the RRS. Implementers are advised to take note that concepts within the value set will continue to expand and evolve when further iterations of the Radiology Referral Set are available.
