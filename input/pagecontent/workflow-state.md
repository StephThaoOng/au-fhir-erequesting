### AU eRequesting Task Status Workflow

AU eRequesting uses a ServiceRequest/Task pattern, where the Task tracks the fulfilment workflow of the ServiceRequest. This section describes how the AU eRequesting Task Diagnostic Request profile is used to track the fulfilment of pathology or imaging diagnostic requests in the context of community-based care in Australia. This guidance builds on the [Task state machine](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/task.html#statemachine).

#### Task State Transitions Overview

The state (status) transitions described here reflect the lifecycle of a Task within AU eRequesting workflows for community-based pathology and imaging.<br>
Not all states (specifically "received", "rejected", and "on-hold"), and not all transitions will be supported in all workflows. Implementers must determine which states and transitions are relevant to their clinical and administrative workflows.<br>
Business rules that define which actors or system roles are permitted to modify a Taskâ€™s status, or to trigger such modifications, are outside the scope of this IG. However, guidance on the coordination between `ServiceRequest.status` and `Task.status` are discussed in the section [ServiceRequest.status Relationship to Task.status](#servicerequeststatus-relationship-to-taskstatus).

#### Task Status Definitions

The [AU eRequesting Task Status](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-erequesting/ValueSet-au-erequesting-task-status.html) value set specifies a constrained subset of Task status values used in the Australian eRequesting context, drawn from the required [TaskStatus](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-task-status.html) value set.

#### Boundaries and Relationships of `Task.status` to `Task.statusReason` and `Task.businessStatus`

- Use `Task.status` to represent the current state of the Task.
- When a `Task.status` is updated, the associated `Task.statusReason` and `Task.businessStatus` should also be reviewed and updated as appropriate to maintain alignment with the new status. If these elements are no longer relevant, they should be cleared to avoid propagating outdated or misleading information beyond the context in which they were originally set.

##### `Task.statusReason`

- Use the optional `Task.statusReason` to provide explanatory context for transitions to states such as "rejected", "failed", or "cancelled".

##### `Task.businessStatus`

- `Task.businessStatus` captures business-specific nuances or substates that provide additional context to the overall `Task.status`. For interoperability, it is intended to surface meaningful, workflow-specific substates that offer value to the placer, patient, or other interested parties - such as improved transparency or additional tracking information. In other words, `Task.businessStatus` serves to augment `Task.status` when further categorisation is useful. If no further categorisation is needed, `Task.businessStatus` may be omitted.
  - For example, `Task.businessStatus` values like "collected", "acquired", or "preliminary" can indicate important workflow milestones while the `Task.status` remains "in-progress".
- At present, there are no enforced rules linking `Task.businessStatus` codes to `Task.status` codes. However, the expected relationships are outlined in the table below to guide implementation. Implementers are encouraged to adopt these patterns to support interoperability, although conformance is not currently enforced. This mapping may be formalised through invariants in future releases of this IG.

#### AU eRequesting Task Group `Task.status` Relationship to AU eRequesting Task Diagnostic Request `Task.status`

- The status of an AU eRequesting Task Group should reflect the lowest (most incomplete) status among its individual AU eRequesting Task Diagnostic Request(s); however, at present, there are no enforced rules.

### AU eRequesting Diagnostic Request Status

#### Request States Overview

In AU eRequesting workflows for community-based pathology and imaging, the state (status) of a Diagnostic Request is managed by the Placer.

#### Request States Table

The [AU eRequesting RequestStatus](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-erequesting/ValueSet-au-erequesting-request-status.html) value set specifies a constrained subset of ServiceRequest status values used in the Australian eRequesting context, drawn from the required [RequestStatus](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-request-status.html) value set.

The Diagnostic Request State table below provides code definitions, and implementation guidance for AU eRequesting workflows.

#### Boundaries and Relationships of `ServiceRequest.status` to `ServiceRequest.statusReason`

- Use `ServiceRequest.status` to represent the current state of the Diagnostic Request.
- `ServiceRequest.statusReason` provides optional explanatory context about why the request is in that particular state. It is not typically required for normal progression through the workflow (e.g., from "active" to "completed"). Instead, it is intended to provide business-relevant context in exception scenarios, such as when a request is placed "on-hold", "revoked", or marked "entered-in-error".
- There is no defined value set for `ServiceRequest.statusReason`. Implementers should ensure that any [CodeableConcept](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#CodeableConcept) used is meaningful, suitable for sharing with other ecosystem participants, and includes a plain text representation of the concept using [CodeableConcept.text](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes-definitions.html#CodeableConcept.text).

#### `ServiceRequest.status` Relationship to `Task.status`

- While Diagnostic Request and Task are loosely coupled, in practice, any transition in `ServiceRequest.status` should be reflected in the corresponding `Task.status` to maintain alignment across resources involved in the workflow, where appropriate. Placer systems are responsible for managing this alignment, as status changes in the Diagnostic Request often imply a shift in the expectations on fulfilment of the Task. This coordination is a key aspect of closed-loop eRequesting. Failure to maintain it can result in workflow inconsistencies, such as orphaned tasks or misaligned expectations between Placers and Fillers.
- Some typical business rules on these status relationships are outlined in the [Request States Table](#request-states-table) above under *Implementation Notes for AU eRequesting Workflows*.
