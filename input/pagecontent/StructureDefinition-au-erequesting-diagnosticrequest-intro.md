### Profile specific implementation guidance
- This abstract profile provides a shared base that is common across requests for specific domains. It is not intended for direct implementation. Where a profile is defined for a specific domain that profile **SHALL** be used:
  - pathology requests **SHALL** use [AU eRequesting Pathology Request](StructureDefinition-au-erequesting-servicerequest-path.html) profile
  - imaging requests **SHALL** use [AU eRequesting Imaging Request](StructureDefinition-au-erequesting-servicerequest-imag.html) profile 
- The provision of an insurance attribute describes a recommendation to be considered by the Filler and does not guarantee that this recommendation will be satisfied.
- The `supportingInfo` element is sliced to represent the following additional supporting information or clinical context  accompanying the request:
  - The patient's **Pregnancy Status** represented by the `supportingInfo:pregnancyStatus` slice as a `Reference`([`Observation Pregnancy - Status (IPS)`](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ips/StructureDefinition-Observation-pregnancy-status-uv-ips.html)).
    - Only the pregnancy status concept of "pregnant" is currently permitted, enforced via invariant `au-ereq-srr-02`, which requires the SNOMED CT code `77386006` (Pregnant).
  - **Clinical Context** narrative information providing an overview of the patient's current clinical situation represented by the `supportingInfo:clinicalContext` slice as a `Reference`([`AU eRequesting Clinical Context DocumentReference`](StructureDefinition-au-erequesting-clinicalcontext-documentreference.html)). 
    - The clinical context is implemented as a plain text string (`text/plain`) embedded inline using `DocumentReference.content.attachment.data` (base64-encoded).
    - Although `ServiceRequest.note` could technically be used for clinical notes, it is limited to notes bound to a single ServiceRequest. In contrast, `supportingInfo:clinicalContext` allows the same clinical context to be referenced across multiple related ServiceRequests within an order.
    - To avoid duplication and support better presentation by Fillers, the AU eRequesting Technical Design Group (TDG) recommends that clinical context shared across requests **SHALL** be captured once in a referenced `DocumentReference` via `supportingInfo`, and not duplicated in `ServiceRequest.note`.
    - Common administrative or clinical information across the group of ServiceRequests in an order should be represented within the `supportingInfo` attribute of the AU eRequesting Diagnostic Request as a commonly referenced FHIR resource, and there should be no overlap in the information held in `ServiceRequest.note` and `ServiceRequest.supportingInfo`, to support the Filler in de-duplicating and clearly presenting the clinical notes across the order.
