### Security and Privacy
When implementing AU eRequesting, implementers need to be aware that security and privacy are essential considerations.

Release 1 of AU eRequesting does not include specific security and privacy requirements and focuses on establishing the foundational data model and RESTful API interactions for diagnostic requesting. Specific security and privacy requirements may be developed in future releases.

Implementers of AU eRequesting are responsible for applying appropriate security and privacy measures, with general requirements provided in [AU Core Security and Privacy](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-core/security.html).
