### Introduction
AU eRequesting is provided to support the use of HL7<sup>&reg;</sup> FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup> for clinical requesting and ordering in an Australian context. It sets the minimum expectations on FHIR resources to support conformance and implementation in systems.

AU eRequesting defines the data model that set the minimum expectations for a system to record, update, search and retrieve information associated with a clinical service request. 

### Project background

TBD - This implementation guide is in the process of being developed, under the governance of the AU eRequesting Technical Design Group within the framework of the [Sparked AU FHIR Accelerator](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HA/Sparked+FHIR+Accelerator). 

The Sparked AU FHIR Accelerator is a community comprising government, technology vendors, provider organisations, peak bodies, practitioners, and domain experts to accelerate the creation and use of national FHIR standards in health care information exchange.

In focus for the Sparked initiative are:
- AU eRequesting Data for Interoperability
- AU eRequesting FHIR Implementation Guide
