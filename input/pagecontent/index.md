### Introduction
AU eRequesting is provided to support the use of HL7<sup>&reg;</sup> FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup> for clinical requesting and ordering in an Australian context. It sets the minimum expectations on FHIR resources to support conformance and implementation in systems.

AU eRequesting sets the minimum expectations for a system to record, update, search and retrieve information associated with a clinical service request. 

### Project background

This implementation guide is under development through the AU eRequesting project as part of the [Sparked AU FHIR Accelerator](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HA/Sparked+FHIR+Accelerator). The Sparked AU FHIR Accelerator is a community comprising government, technology vendors, provider organisations, peak bodies, practitioners, and domain experts, to accelerate the creation and use of national FHIR standards in health care information exchange.

The AU eRequesting project includes:
- AU eRequesting Data for Interoperability
- AU eRequesting FHIR Implementation Guide

AU Core R1 is in currently in development. Ballot for Comment is scheduled for March 2024.

#### Identify future work or raise discussion points

To identify future work or raise discussion points, you can post in the Australia stream https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179173-australia or raise [specification feedback](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HL7/Specification+Feedback) through a [Jira issue tracker](https://jira.hl7.org/issues/?filter=21325).


##### Discuss with the team

Once the issue is logged, you should discuss with the team on [chat.fhir.org in the australia > AU Request topic](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179173-australia/topic/AU.20eRequest) before attempting to make changes yourself. It's important to coordinate with the other people working on the project.
